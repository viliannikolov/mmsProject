// LINUX COMMANDS TO FIND MAX AND MIN FROM A FILE OF REAL NUMBERS
// working with numbers from file numbers3.txt

sort -n numbers3.txt | head -1    =>   sorting the numbers in (ascending order by default) and PIPING to head -1 which grabs the first line only, which is the smallest number 

sort -nr numbers3.txt | head -1   =>   same as the previous command, but the -r is reversing the default order(ascending order) of the sort func,
so it sorts the numbers in (descending order) and grabs the highest number
