Program is first written in a text editor (vi, vim, emacs etc).
Program is compiled in order to be translated into machine (object) code.
Often the program we wrote needs to use other programs or library of programs in order to be executed. That is when “linking” is taking place. 
“Linking” connects all needed programs and functions in order to execute the program you wrote. There are two ways to make linking happen: 1) Static linking and 2) Dynamic linking.
When linking can be performed: a) compilation time — when code is translated into machine code, b) load time — when program is loaded into memory, c) run time.
 Linking is the last step before making the file with your program executable.

    Linking time
Static: happens as the last step of the compilation process. After the program is placed in the memory.
Dynamic: shared libraries are added during linking process when executable file and libraries are added to the memory.

 Static - is to be performed by the Linker!
 Dynamic - is to be performed by OS

 The separate files made by preprocessor, compiler,assembler and linker weren't successfully made because of an error in the code in car.c
